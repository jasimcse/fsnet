<h3>Welcome on FSNet, a Firm Social Network Project.</h3>

<p>
    The aim of this project is to develop a social network application in
    Java/JEE technologie to connect the members of a specific structure,
    such as a company or a faculty.
</p>

<p>
    At the difference of current social networking applications, the membership
    is limited to the sole members of the structures or some people invited by
    those members.
