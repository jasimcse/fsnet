#This page describe how you can import fsnet in your IDE

= Introduction =

As you can see in the source repository there is no specific IDE files in. The main idea is to let each developer choose his preferred Integrated Development Environment.

= Using Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo) JEE edition  =

== Install some plugins for eclipse ==

  * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA Subclipse]
  * [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html m2eclipse]
    WARNING : Currently, m2eclipse project is divided in two different update sites ! You MUST install each one.
    * From m2eclipse core update site : 
      * Maven integration for eclipse
    * From m2eclipse extras update site :
      * Maven integration for WTP
      * Maven handler for Subclipse
      * Maven SCM integration 
      * Project configurators for commonly used maven plugins

== Check out sources ==

  * Perform a right click in the project explorer view
  * Choose Import -> maven -> Check out maven project from SCM
  * Choose "svn" for the select input.
  * Copy/paste in the text field this url : https://fsnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
    Note : if you're not a team member you can checkout using http instead of https
  * Click on finish and wait for a while (maven is downloading all the dependencies for you :-))

== Install tomcat in Eclipse ==

  * First, be sure that you are under the Java EE perspective
  * Locate the "Servers" view
  * Perform a right click on it
  * Select new -> server
  * in the server list choose : Apache -> Tomcat v6.0 Server
  * Click on next
  * Fill the tomcat installation directory
  * Click on finish

Now you should be ready to develop on fsnet.
