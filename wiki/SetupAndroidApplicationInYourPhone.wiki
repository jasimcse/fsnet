With this page you can setup your own android application in your smartphone phone.

0.2/ see http://code.google.com/p/fsnet/wiki/CreateAndroidProject to make your first application.

1/ connect your phone in your computer. In your settings : the phone must be in a debug USB mode.

2/ check the phone is connected to your computer (in command line : lsusb).

3/ in command line :

- cd /etc/udev/rules.d/

- sudo gedit 51-android.rules

-> add the line to "51-android.rules" : 
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0bb4", MODE="0666" 

here 0bb4 is for an htc smartphone. 
If your phone is not htc go to http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html#setting-up and find your code.
